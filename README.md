# bicycleStatus
A small app for myself to know if I left my bicycle at office and came walking to home. This app will remind me in the next morning that I don't have my cycle with me and I have to walk to work instead. This will help me better plan my time for commute.


This PWA app has a simple interface asking me if I left my bicyle at work or not that has to be manually set by me everytime I choose to walk home or take bus.

This app will check my bicycle's location every morning and notify me if I left my bicycle at office.
